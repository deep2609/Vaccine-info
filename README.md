# ðŸ’‰ Vaccine-Info

Vaccine-Info is a maintained Project made by **[Pranshu Kashyap](https://github.com/pranshukas)** and **[Souradip Mandal](https://github.com/deep2609)**. It uses Cowin API's to fetch Real-time Vaccine Slots Available in Pin Code or Districts and displays to users. Additionally, it has another great Functionality Vaccine-Notifier. Users can subscribe in case vaccine is not available, and it will check and automatically send Emails whenever new slots are available in the nearest area. Additionally, we have also added a webpage that displays real-time Covid-19 Cases (Fetched using API's) and details of Vaccines available and Breaking News Related to Covid and Vaccinations. 

We have used node-cron for scheduling tasks and node-mailer for Sending Emails. MongoDB was used to Store User Data. Cowin API's are used for fetching real-time Vaccine slots. Chart.js was used for plotting Doughnut Pie Charts and NewsAPIs were used for getting News Headlines related to Covid.
